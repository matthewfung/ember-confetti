This addon exposes an `{{confetti-rain}}` component for your ember application.

![Sample](./confetti.gif)

You can see it in action in this [demo page](https://san650.github.io/ember-confetti/).

## Usage

Install the addon and insert the component in any template.

```hbs
{{confetti-rain}}
```

The component will start a confetti rain when rendered or you can toggle the rain by setting the `isEnabled` attribute.

```hbs
{{!--

  No confetti rain :-(

--}}

{{confetti-rain isEnabled=false}}
```

### Number of particles

By default, a total of 150 particles are rendered, you can change this number by setting `maxParticles`.

```hbs
{{confetti-rain maxParticles=10}}
```

### Overriding z-index

By default `z-index` is set to max 32bit integer value, to override this you can set a custom class to the component and set your desired `z-index` value.

```hbs
{{confetti-rain class="my-confetti"}}
```

```css
.my-confetti {
  z-index: 10!important;
}
```

Note that you need to use the `!important` suffix so the rule is applied correctly.

### Full screen

By default `confetti-rain` component will fill parent's container. If you want to render the component to fill the entire screen you can use [`ember-wormhole`](https://github.com/yapplabs/ember-wormhole#ember-wormhole--) to achieve this.

```sh
$ ember install ember-wormhole
```

And then you can change your templates like this

`my-foo-component.hbs`

```hbs
{{#ember-wormhole to="my-container"}}
  {{confetti-rain}}
{{/ember-wormhole}}
```

And place the container at `<body>` level.

`application.hbs`

```hbs
{{yield}}
<div id="my-container"></div>
```

And that's it, now the parent container for the `confetti-rain` component will be the `<body>` tag.
